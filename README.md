ICFP2013 web service proxy
====

This is a proxy for the ICFP2013 web service.

It's live at http://icfp2013lf.herokuapp.com and has exact same interface as the web service.

Features:
[x] automatic authorization - I think it's fine as long as we don't publicize the address,
[ ] throttling
[ ] local problem generation
[ ] caching
[ ] sanity checking
[ ] IRC bot reporting
[ ] other ideas? Open an issue.
